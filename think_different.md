### Differentiaition

### Translated instructions

- The school that I work at is located in Queens. Our school population is largely Bengali, and hispanic so if lessons require alot of instruction I print out a translated lesson.

- This way students can follow along while they work. Also when teaching AP computer science I use code hs has the lessons as a youtube video. This allows a visual that can also have translated captions.


### Small group insturuction

- I also use small group instruction. Being that I teach computer science I often assist students with the same problem and they call me on different sides of the room to do so. If I know students will have the same issue I group them together and have a mini classroom tutoring session to get their programs working.


### Different levels

- I also understand that all of my students have different strengths and capapbilities. I aide some stuggling students to get to a basic program completion and allow them to feel proud of their accomplishments.
