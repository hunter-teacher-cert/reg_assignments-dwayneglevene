### Podcast response

~ In listening to the podcast I thought it would be about a more broader spectrum but its focus was primarely for computer science education teachers so I knew it was going to be information I can use.


### Agree or Disagree

 ~ The podcast brought up some really valid points that I do agree with. One of which was that education can sometimes feel like a scramble for points. My students often ask me when given a project, how many points do they need for a 5. They never ask what do they have to do to prove mastery to recieve that 5. Its a push for points not push for understanding thus causing students to feel anxious about their education.

 ~ The podcast also stated that it is their experience that computer science and the teaching of computer science is often catered to the needs of white males.Students who are under privileged usually dont know they can ask for extra time on assignments become stressed and will thus submit sub par work and get a lower grade.


### Implementation
 ~ * Would you apply this information ? *

 ~ I definetly would take into consideration what was said about people of color not knowing how to or know of the right thay have in their education to ask for more time.I would be transparent with students and notify them from the beginning and throughout a project of due dates but that losing points are less important than not submitting at all. I would prefer late quality work then on time mediocre assignmnets.
