#This is an example for students to follow for assignment

# NYC crime tracker

* The program is a tracker of New york city's crime , to track id the decrease in covid hospitaliotns ans mask use has deceased crime

- I chose to create this program because the media has been depicted the city as it is in its worse state. I created an app to actually use real life arrest data to prove that true or false

## Pseudocode

1) Display welcome message to oncoming user,
explain the purpose of the program and why it is necessary

2) Give user prompt to put in year they would like to check for arrest data

3)As user input year arrest show up on screen for the year interms of offense,description arrest date and key number

4) Havee user see vidualization graph and see the numbers of a specific crime like robbery

5)Follow steps 2,3, & 4 but using the present year and allow user to note the difference and determine if we have made improvements in city safety over covid 19.
