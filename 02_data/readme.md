* This is a good resource for NYC ddata but feel free to get your data from anywhere
https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/


## Step   2:
 * Explain why you found this data interesting and how it can be applied to programming. 

  ~ Why did you choose this, what makes you want to create an app or program for it.                                                                                                                                                
## Step 3:

- This pseudocode is to be followed by fellow classmates so it has to be clear and precise to the programs intention and goal

- Break down your steps from intro to user input to data use
