# Standard
3A-AP-14:
Use lists to simplify solutions, generalizing computational problems instead of repeatedly using simple variables.

Aim: Swbat to create and store data in an array

* Do now:
Have you ever collected something? Yugioh Cards, Pokemon cards, etc.. What was it 


# Mini lesson:
Welcome to data structures, we have to store our information :
We can use an array/ list that lets you keep track of an ordered collection of items
Shopping list
Album tracklist
To do list
Followers list on social media

You may have notice that our array started counting from 0 instead of 1, this is how all arrays are counted

Indexing an array means to filter through the collection and find the item you want

# Worktime:

Code HS
Lets practice
Unit 7
Intro to Arrays  7.1.4 & 7.1.5
&
Indexing into an Array 7.2.4

# Exit ticket:

 Write comments in your program and explain what indexing is as if I was a brand new student
