# Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.

 ## Why do you think it didn't go well?


* A time when I was teaching computer science and it went terribly was my first week teaching. My first time teaching commputer science was my first time teaching period, it actaully occured only because I stepped in for another teacher leaving for maternity leave. Coming into the situation I had to learn the curriculm the night before every lesson so I wasnt that knowledgeable of the content. Also my lessons were weak due to the fact that I had no teaching experience. *

## What would you do (have you done) to make it better?

* I think it would have been much better if I had actual time to learn the content. My school really just needed someone ASAP and they put me into the classroom. It left me frustrated and thus unsuccesful in my first year. I should have started in September and had the summer to prepare and plan my curriculum. *

## Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.

* An instance when I taught something computer science related and it went well was when I taught students how to create their own app. In my computer science class I taught students arrays, functions, parameters, and etc , enough for students to create their own programs. They decided to create alot of creative things like a sneaker store or a gaming app and felt proud of their hard work. Students were so proud they would call me over to their seat not to ask a question but to show off their work. *

## Why do you think it went so well?

* I think it went well because I allowed students to create things of their own interest. This kept attention to the task and compeled them to finish the product. *
